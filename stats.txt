Continuous random variables  -->  
Discrete random variables  --> Binomial, Negative binomial,Geometric, Poisson

Hypothesis Testing

Normality Test
---------------------
Correlation Test
---------------------

Parametric  --> Z-test, student's T-test, ANOVA, CHi-square        (mean)
Non Parametric  --> Kruskal wallis, Mann whitney/wilcoxin sign/rank test (median/location/position)

Empirical rule  --> If the size of the data that belongs to a natural phenomenon is more than 30,(more than 100)
statistically it tends to follow normal distribution.
 
Central Limit theorem --> The more data you have the more chances gaussian/normal distribution it follows

# The sales manager is claiming in the last year sales has increased to 20 lacs. 
Is that true or is it just random by chance?
Is there a statistical evidence to prove his claim?


# One sample Test
avg(sales) --> 20 years --> 15l (5l)    (Population)
avg(sales)-->last year--> 20l             (Sample)

# Two sample Test

avg(marks) --> Batch 1
avg(marks) --> Batch 2

Batch2 > Batch 1

# One -tailed Test / Directional Test

avg(sales) of sample > avg(sales) of population
avg(sales) of sample1 < avg(sales) of sample2

# Two-tailed Test / Non-directional Test

avg(sales) of sample =! avg(sales) of population
avg(sales) of sample1 =! avg(sales) of sample2


# one sample tests

# State Hypothesis

NULL hypothesis  --> sample_mean == population_mean

Alternate Hypothesis  --> sample_mean > population_mean (One tailed)

# sample_mean != population_mean (Two tailed)

# Note down all the details

n = 30
Population_mean = 100
sample_mean = 112.5
std.dev(pop) = 15

# Find out weather it's a one tailed or two tailed test 

# Apply the appropriate test

Z test --> used when the data is normally distributed & the standard deviation of the population is known.

T-test --> if the data is not normally distributed or std. of population is not known

ANOVA --> Two or more samples

Chi-square --> For categorical variables

# Test statistics needs to be calculated

Test stats --> 4.56

# Compare that with the Critical value (Degrees of freedom needs to be obtained in case of T-test, ANOVA, CHI-square)

For all one tailed z-test with alpha 0.05  --> 1.645
For all two-tailed z-test with alpha 0.05 --> 1.96 

# If the Test stats is greater than the critical value, Alternate Hypothesis otherwise NULL hypothesis

Test Stats(4.56) > Critical.value(1.645) & hence reject H0 and accept (Ha) ALTERNATE HYPOTHESIS

# Yes, Principal's claim is statistically significant enough.

# 2nd problem

H0  --> sample_mean == population_mean
Ha --> sample_mean != population_mean  [ two-tailed ]

Type 1 Error : False positive (Accepted Ha) instead of rejecting it
